Boris Bikes
======================

## What is it?
A Ruby program modeling London's bike rental scheme, to help manage docking station capacity and bike repairs. This was written during my second and third weeks at Makers Academy.

## How it was done

After a short brief, my teammates and I used class-responsibility-collaboration cards to determine how the program would be structured, in terms of the classes we would need and their responsibilities.

We then started pair-programming to write the first tests and make them pass.

## Technologies

- Ruby
- Rspec
